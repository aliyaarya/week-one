Since the course is set up much differently then what i was used to with prior courses that mainly utilized culearn so I had some navigational difficulty using the website but eventually navigated it ease
While creating my github, during the sign up process I encountered minor errors/problems. One of the errors included my password being to weak and that I needed to choose a stronger password
I had some difficulty with discord as a couple of the times that I attempted to login, it would successfully log me in but leave me stuck on a page that read “welcome back, beep boop? Beep boop.” and then proceeded to bring me back to the login page and proceeds to tell me my email does not exist as an account on the website
With regards to failures I might have encountered is attempting to sign up to the websites that we needed to if the professor had not provided pictures. Without the pictures I would have surely found difficulty with navigating through the websites and would have needed to seek help.
